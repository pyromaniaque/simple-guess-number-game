## Simple guess the number game

In this game you play against bot that uses method similar to binary search, but i made it less difficult to win, so bot guesses are randomized

There is **no external config** for this game, so if you want to change algo, you will need to dig into the code

**Range looks like this**
```rust
    let min_value = 1u32;
    let max_value = 100u32;
```

The bot automaticly adjust its range during the game, dont edit it manually

This is my small project to learn **rust** a bit more. = D
